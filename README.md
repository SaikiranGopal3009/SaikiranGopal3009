## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my Github!

- ðŸ”­ I'm a digital twin innovator currently building projects pertinent to simulation using AI for training & optimizing autonomous vehicles and industrial robots. I am particularly interested in Deep Learning, Perception, Sensor fusion and photo-realistic Rendering tech stacks.

- âš¡ Fun fact: ...I love to play the piano in my free time and I love cortados! Also, I have a PhD in Aeronautics & Astronautics (Area of research: Digital Twins & Product Failure Simulations) which was one of the most challenging experiences of my life.
